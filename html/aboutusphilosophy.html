                    We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.	  
                    ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here for you!  
                    ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none – all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements.  
                    We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.  You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate. 
                    We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!

                    Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump into the ring as your sparring partner. 
                    For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene. He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with passion and enthusiasm. 
                    The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly energised. 
                    Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer, you will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best cardiovascular workouts available.
